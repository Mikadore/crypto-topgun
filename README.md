# Cryptographic systems

This repository will contain several different examples of cryptographic 
systems, a brief overview of them, and an implementation/example of each.

## Disclaimer

Cryptography is a sensitive subject, breaks in major cryptographic 
libraries, such as heartbleed have showed us how vulnerable modern
computer systems can be.

In this vein, I am not a security researcher or expert in any of the
subjects covered within this repository. This is just a learning project. 

All the code examples are written by me and licensed under the MIT license,
