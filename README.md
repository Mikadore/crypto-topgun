# Cryptographic systems

This repository will contain several different examples of cryptographic 
systems, a brief overview of them, and an implementation/example of each.

## Order of contents

This is the order in which different technologies/ciphers/topics were added:

1. [Caesar cipher](caesar)

In general, examples should be self contained, and they depend on each other 
they should be referencing said dependance. However, the order of creation
does serve as some sort of progression in the topic of Cryptography,
and the concepts tend to build ontop of each other.

## Disclaimer

Cryptography is a sensitive subject, breaks in major cryptographic 
libraries, such as heartbleed have showed us how vulnerable modern
computer systems can be.

In this vein, I am not a security researcher or expert in any of the
subjects covered within this repository. This is just a learning project.
